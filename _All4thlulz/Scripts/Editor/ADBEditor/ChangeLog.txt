0.7.5
- Added pumkin avatar tools dependecy check

0.7.4 (First Release On GitHub)
- Added scale correction when copying (radius, end offset, gravity, force) to a new dynamic bone
- When creating a missing gameobject during dynamic bone collider copy, it will also attempt to recreate any missing parent hierarchy for it to be childed correctly
- Fixed model scale being falsely detected as a mismatch due to floating point accuracy
- Fixed scale correction multiplier falsely detecting a mismatch due to floating point accuracy
- Output log is now categorised for both easier readability and to help avoid gui text length limitations
- Output log will now automatically expand categories that contain errors
- Added basic pumkin tools v0.4b integration. You must have the tool downloaded before enabling integration from the script

0.7.3
- Fixed dynamic bone collider radius and height being incorrect if the imported scales and local scales for each reference gameobject do not match
- Copying a dynamic bone collider without a parent reference should now log an error

0.7.2
- Fixed open output log button not becoming active due to the last outputlog not correctly saving
- Fixed output log window not expanding when loading from the pref saved outputlog 
- Always switch reference for root gameobject now defaults to false. (so it actually displays for new users)

0.7.1
- User settings are now saved and should no longer revert to default when the window or editor is closed
- Fixed null reference exception  when an exclusion reference is missing during copy
- Fixed an issue where the newModel scale could end up incorrect when undo is used in some cases
- Added check for references being the root gameobject. (help new users due to EDB expecting the armature but ADB can use anything)

0.7.0
- Added the ability to remove empty dynamic bone collider and exclusion references. (Enabled in settings by default)
- Added check for existing dynamic bones that reference the same root. Output logging only for now
- Added check for existing dynamic bone colliders. Output logging only for now
- Copying output log to clipboard no longer closes the window
- Fixed an issue where root skip count was never getting incremented

Change log:
0.6.1
- Reduced outputlog lines for multi line debug logs
- Reduced outputlog text size
- Fixed output log exceeding screen height

0.6.0
- Fixed transform position and rotation mismatch from affecting dynamic bone collider copying successfuly
- Removed position and rotation transform mismatch check
- Reduced ask to save spam
- Added settings tab
- Added simple outputlog
- Added dubug and save toggles
- Added transform mismatch settings

0.5.3
- Added alert for duplicate gameobject names when copying exclusion references
- Fixed transform matching not being detected (known issue: scale may be incorrectly detected as wrong)
- Changed script id so you can now run EDBP and ADBP in the same project

0.5.2
- Fixed null reference excepction when a collider reference is missing during copy
- Fixed FixReferences parent reference getting replaced when not necessary

0.5.1
- Added advanced copy (bypasses some armature checks so that the user can manually copy if they know what they are doing)
- Require both references before a copy can proceed
- Fixed dynamic bone collider copy failing if the gameobject does not exist on the new model
- Fixed dynamic bone components not being copied if multiple exist on one gameobject
- Fixed dynamic bone root not referencing the correct gameobject
- Added failsafe situations for references that can utilise the reference fixer when the user has dealt with any errors
- Added separate copy buttons
- Added log messages to help if something goes wrong
- Added undo support for newly created gameobjects and components
- Added transform matching for specific use cases that may need it
- Added ask user to save changes
- Added FixReferences.cs code to ADBCopy
